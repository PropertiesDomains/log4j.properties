*Log4j.properties* is a configuration file for the 
[log4j](http://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/) logging framework.

Recently, '.properties' became a 
[gTLD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generic_top-level_domain). This means that
combined search / URL bars will no longer conduct searches for the filename,
and instead route to [http://log4j.properties/](http://log4j.properties/). This
site was set up to help connect searchers find resources on log4j.
